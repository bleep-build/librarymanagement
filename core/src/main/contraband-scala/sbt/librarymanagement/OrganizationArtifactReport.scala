/**
 * OrganizationArtifactReport represents an organization+name entry in Ivy resolution report.
 * In sbt's terminology, "module" consists of organization, name, and version.
 * In Ivy's, "module" means just organization and name, and the one including version numbers
 * are called revisions.
 * 
 * A sequence of OrganizationArtifactReport called details is newly added to ConfigurationReport, replacing evicted.
 * (Note old evicted was just a seq of ModuleIDs).
 * OrganizationArtifactReport groups the ModuleReport of both winners and evicted reports by their organization and name,
 * which can be used to calculate detailed eviction warning etc.
